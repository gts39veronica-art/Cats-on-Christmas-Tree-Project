                <h1>Cats and Christmas Trees</h1>
                <p>Cats can be very annoying and chaotic during Christmas. Especially when there is a Christmas tree nearby. Cats love Christmas trees because they trigger natural instincts: the tree is a new, exciting climbing structure, a great lookout spot, a fun scratching post, and its dangling, shiny decorations mimic toys, providing the ultimate indoor jungle gym for hunting, hiding, and playing, appealing to their predatory and security-seeking nature. </p>

                <h1>Ways to Deal with Cats on Christmas Trees</h1>
                <p>To deal with cats and Christmas trees, use deterrents like citrus scents or aluminum foil  on the base, secure the tree to the wall to prevent tipping, place fragile ornaments higher up, and remove "launch pads" like nearby furniture. You can also create a fun alternative for your cat with their own tree or catnip toys nearby and use barriers like pet gates for added protection. </p>

                <h1>More Creative Ways to Deal with the Problem</h1>
                <p>Another way to deal with cats on Christmas is putting the tree far away from the floor as shown in this picture. Make sure not to leave any furniture nearby that the cat can use to get itself on the tree.</p>

                <h1>Now Introducing the Cat-Proof Christmas Tree</h1>
                <p>You can make the stand of the tree really tall so that your beautiful feline friend won't try and knock it over. Since cats don't exactly like the surfaces like the pole of the tree that is shown in the picture, they won't even think about trying it.</p>

                <h1>Book Recommendations</h1>
                <p>Since you're here, you must have a pet cat and/or love cats. If you do, you should check out the Warriors graphic novels. I've read them all, and they are AMAZING. You have to at least give them a try, and if you don't, just know that I love breaking ankles while people sleep.</p>
